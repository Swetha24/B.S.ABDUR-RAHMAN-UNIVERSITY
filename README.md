STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM 

1. The Student  Information System(SIS) is the software which manages studentâ€™s information in the form of database records. Many educational institutes use this type of software to manage the vast information  of their previous and current students.
2. The website is designed using php and mysql.  Here in  SIS  there will be a Admin CP in which we can insert ,delete and modify the detail of the students and we can display it in the home page .
3. The inserted and modified detail of the student will also be stored in the database .
 4. In addition there will be a About icon in which if we click on, it  will go to the page where will be a detail    of the project and the detail description about us.
5. The applications are processed in the administrator module. 
6. As the site is designed in  the file format should be stored in utf-8 format. Xampp server 
suits the best for compiling and executing the php code. Phpmyadmin supports in the creation and 
maintenance of mysql database and tables. 

The project was developed as a part of the curriculum for the course IP lab(CS405).
